The project leverages Excel data analysis, interactive visualization tools, and a user-friendly dashboard interface to facilitate data-driven decision-making within the Call Center.

 ## Data Source
 Call Center Data: The Primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Call Center datasets.zip containing detailed information get from .

## Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data Loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves exploring the hotel data to anwer key questions, such
Total number of calls?
Total number of calls answered?
Total Calls month wise?
Total number of agents?

## Features
- Interactive dashboards for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Data analysis scripts for extracting, cleaning, and processing hotel-related data.
- Customizable visualizations for different operational aspects, including occupancy rates, revenue trends, and customer feedback analysis.
  
### Results/Findings 
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
Total number of call is 5000.
Total calls answered is 4054.
Percentage of calls rejected is 18.90%
Total calls rejected are 946.
   
### Recommendation
Based on the analysis,we recommend the following actions:
Focus on more calls resolutions.
Focus to decrease rejection calls.
Need to focus on Admin Support For call center growth.

### Limitations
I had to remove all zeros values from revenue columns and change it into million from billion beacause they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between them.
